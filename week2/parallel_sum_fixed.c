/*
 * 03_parallel_sum.c
 *
 * A more realistic scenario than a bare counter: we have a large
 * array of numbers, and we want to compute the sum across multiple
 * threads.
 *
 * The first (broken) approach in this file: split the array into
 * chunks, give each thread a chunk, and have each thread add its
 * chunk's values into a shared `total`.
 *
 * The expected sum is well-defined: we fill the array with all 1s,
 * so the sum is exactly ARRAY_SIZE. After running, compare what we
 * got vs what we expected. The mismatch is the race condition.
 *
 * Goal of this example:
 *   - Show that race conditions are not just about toy counters.
 *   - Real parallel work can have the same bug.
 *   - Set the stage for Week 2, where we'll fix it properly.
 *
 * Compile:
 *   gcc -Wall -pthread 03_parallel_sum.c -o parallel_sum
 *
 * Run:
 *   ./parallel_sum
 *
 * Modify NUM_THREADS and re-run. More threads -> usually more error.

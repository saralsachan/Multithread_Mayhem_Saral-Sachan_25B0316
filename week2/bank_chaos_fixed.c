/*
 * 04_bank_chaos.c
 *
 * A more realistic race condition that looks like a real-world bug.
 *
 * We simulate a shared bank account with a starting balance of $10000.
 * Two threads represent two customers, each of whom tries to make
 * many small withdrawals. Each withdrawal is guarded by a balance
 * check: only proceed if there's enough money.
 *
 * The check-then-act pattern is the classic source of the
 * "how did the account go negative?" bug. The check and the act
 * are two separate steps, and another thread can do its own
 * withdrawal in between them.
 *
 * Goal of this example:
 *   - See a race condition in code that looks more like real
 *     business logic, not a toy counter.
 *   - Watch the balance possibly go negative, or watch the
 *     successful-counts disagree with the balance.
 *
 * Compile:
 *   gcc -Wall -pthread 04_bank_chaos.c -o bank_chaos
 *
 * Run several times:
 *   ./bank_chaos
 *
 * You'll often see a final balance that's negative — which a bank
 * would consider a serious problem.
